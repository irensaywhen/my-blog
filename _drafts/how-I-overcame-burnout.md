Have you ever felt you don't feel excited about what you do? I did - around the end of the last december.
I'd been hearing about burnouts in programming industry a lot. Nearly everyone mentioned at least once that the burnout is real. Never took it seriously till those days.

Here I want to share my thoughts on that period, as well as some tips helped me to get out of it without throwing away my computer.

## Feelings

It was kinda weird because I had a lot of work to do, and a lot of goals I wanted to achieve. I launched my blog in November, and planned to rush with React. How wrong I was!

My feelings: don't want to do freelance job
Don't want to do my own projects
Tired of sitting in front of the computer

I NEVER thought that I picked the wrong way. I felt I still should love to code, yet I wasn't able to feel it.

What helped me out to overcome the disease:

1. Change the pace, do something crazy an unusual.
   I was doing primary JavaScript, while working in a team using laravel for the backend. So I decided to try PHP and get back to backend.
   Traversy media launched a new course those days, and it helped me to start enjoing something different.
   Two tips:
   Love yourself. Burnout is like a disease. You need to help your sick brain to get out of it.
   Be open-minded. Don't be afraid to try new things.

2. Forget about sticking to your commitments for some time.
   Your goals are important. Yet if you give yourself time, you won't drop coding off if you do like it.

3. Give yourself something special
   What helped me a lot is to walk and talk with my best friend. We've been hanging out a lot during that time, discussing our plans for the future and what we need to achieve them.
   It helped me to feel alive again, and get the desire to do things.

4. Eat something tasty. Give yourself presents.
   I mean, really. Especially if you don't eat much during work or do it in a hurry.

Then, when I felt a bit more alive rather than dead, I realized I need a change. I can't do the same stuff day after day.
So this is what I changed in my everyday routine:

### I felt I need a change

After all those remedies, I started to feel myself more alive rather than dead. Yet I felt very uncomfortable, starting thinking about getting back to normal rhymth.  
It was a disaster because time never waits.  
I realized I need to change the way I deal with my everyday routine.  
So here's what I decided to try to make my life more joyful and entertaining, while doing things I need to do:

#### Pick more projects

Do you think I'm crazy? Sure, I am.  
How can it help to be more energetic when you already feel extremely exhausted?

I often hear "learn one thing at a time". For me it's bullshit as it turns out. I quickly get bored.
So if you like me, you can try to maintain several projects at once. Maybe you'll even build them faster, as you'll want to have progress in each of them!

#### Work from different places

What really helped me is to change place a couple of times during the day. Otherwise, I want to throw my computer away by the end of the day.

#### Do what you love

Don't do projects you don't enjoy (especially if it's educational projects). Your time is precious. Spend it wisely.

#### Learn something besides code

If you're a freelancer or a self-taught, you might be focused purely on code. You don't have a minor as you did in university. So try to find it.
It can be something related to the industry, or something absolutely different. It will help your work anyway, as it will broaden your knowledge in a different direction.

#### Take more time off during weekends

It's extremely important to spend time outside of your table. Probably you have family and friends, or Netflix at the very least. Or a good book and a favorite restaurant.
Your weekend is the time that might help you in a long run. Force yourself to have some rest.

#### Learn to understand your body and your feelings

Burnout doesn't happen in one day. You should have been torturing yourself for a while if the burnout eventually came up.  
Try to understand your feelings and your desires. Give yourself what you want, not what you think you want.

Topics:

1. Burnout is real
2. What did I felt and why
3. What I tried to do
