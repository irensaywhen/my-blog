If you're thinking about using a website constructor for your portfolio site or your small business, read this article to know what's waiting for you around the corner!

Recently a friend of mine asked me to help him with his website which he decided to built using Tilda.
Being curious about different technologies in web industry, I decided to give this small project a shot.

A small introduction:
My friend is a designer. He wanted a small portfolio website, which he wanted to firstly build on his own.
He was pretty short in money, and he thought to use free Tilda plan, as its domain is fine for him, and templates look pretty clean.
He needed some assitante with .... (write with what he needed assitantse)

## About Tilda project

### Overview

### How tilda works in general

## Pros

### Blocks and templates

### Custom fonts

You can upload your fonts if you need which is pretty cool. If I would develop a page builder, I would allow it only for premium users.

### Visual interface to perform customizations

### Preatty neat animations if you need them

### CMS and CRM

If it's important, then yes. It has both of these. Obviously, I didn't check what CRM gives you, yet I saw it exists.
And of course, being a Website Builder, Tilda has a nice-looking CMS.

## Cons:

### Free plan is pretty limited

- Very few free temlates and UI elements. Some crusial elements, such as custom sticky mobile menu are available onlly in paid plan.
- Paid plan is pricy.

### Paid plan is pricy

In comparison to having a Wordpress website, for example.
Compare price with hosting

### Paid plan is pretty limited, too

If you'd want any custom functionality that is not available

### Customization is hell

Tilda is a pretty powerful tool, as I discovered. It has an ability to add custom blocks, for example, which you can make from scratch.
The only problem is that you'll have to learn Tilda way of doing things, read its documentation, etc. Which is not what you want when you're building a website on your own.
For me as a developer, it would be WAY easier to perform customizations with good old html/css/javascript/whatsoever than learning a completely new tool.
So where's the profit? Developers would spend less time using other tools. Not developers won't use that complex features at all as that features have pretty steep learning curve
for an ordinary person.

### You can't customize everything, anyway

### Without an eye on design it's pretty useless (my opinion)

Not on every design, really! You should know what looks good in web projects. Otherwise, your website **will** become a monster.

### You'll have to solve A LOT OF problems with responsiveness

Yes, Tilda **IS** responsive. Hovewer, if you'll want to make the overall page look good on mobile, you'll have to be very creative.
You'll encounter tons of issues that will need workarounds.
One problem we faced was with creating a nice flow of text and pictures by flipping them from left to right in sections. Pretty common pattern.
Hovewer, we quickly discovered that we cannot use the same blocks for it, as this flow looks awful on mobile.
