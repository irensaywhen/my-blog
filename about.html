            Hi :) <br> My name is Iren, and as you may have noticed, this is the place where I'll put my thoughts for everyone to see.
        </p>
        
        <p class="{{ text_style }}">
            I'm a freelance frontend developer with a focus on template development and customization. Being interested in user experience concepts, I like to think of people's behavior and build delightful products for humans.

            When it comes to learning, I always start with fundamental concepts, as I love to understand how things work. Forcing me to dig into every detail of physical proofs, my physics used yo say:  "Don't believe anyone. Even me". He influenced me a lot and not only formed my passion for learning in-depth concepts but also taught me to think critically and mathematically.<br>
            
        </p>
        <p class="{{ text_style }}">
            When I'm not coding, I walk, talk, and listen to music. As with everything else in my life, I like to dig deep. So I'm passionate about figuring out the internal concepts of albums, their connections, and influences.
